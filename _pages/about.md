# From Concepts to Deployed AI

## Building AI, One Project at a Time

Every project is an opportunity to learn and innovate. From NLP chatbots to computer vision applications, I take ideas from concept to deployment, creating practical AI solutions that solve real-world problems.

## Exploring the Future of AI
AI is constantly evolving, and so am I. I stay up-to-date with the latest research, tools, and techniques, experimenting with new models and architectures to understand what‚Äôs next in the world of machine learning.

## From Ideas to AI Solutions
I transform concepts into functioning applications. Whether it‚Äôs designing a data pipeline, training a model, or deploying a service on AWS, I focus on building AI solutions that are scalable, efficient, and impactful.

## Machine Learning in Action
I love putting theory into practice. By building hands-on projects and experimenting with datasets, I demonstrate how machine learning can automate tasks, provide insights, and enhance decision-making in diverse domains.

## Turning Data into Intelligence
Data is at the heart of AI. I specialize in extracting meaningful insights from data, applying machine learning models, and deploying intelligent systems that help businesses and users make smarter decisions.



# Selected Experience

## Natural Language Processing (NLP):
I built chatbots, sentiment analysis tools, and text summarization models by experimenting with transformer architectures (BERT, T5), pre-trained embeddings (FastText, Word2Vec), as well as creating my own embeddings and training custom models. I applied fine-tuning techniques to adapt these models to specific tasks, resulting in applications that enhanced user engagement and automated content workflows.

## Computer Vision: 
Developed image recognition and object detection systems using YOLOv8/v11, FaceInsight, OpenCV, and scikit-learn. Leveraged transfer learning and custom models to enable accurate visual analysis for real-world applications, including automated inspection and image classification.

## Generative AI: 
Implemented text and image generation models using GANs, diffusion models, and large language models, producing creative AI outputs that demonstrate practical and experimental innovation.

## Agentic AI: 
Designed autonomous AI agents that perform decision-making tasks and automated workflows. I achieved this by combining reinforcement learning, planning algorithms, and simulation environments, creating systems that solve complex tasks with minimal supervision.

## Traditional Machine Learning: 
Built predictive models and classification systems using scikit-learn, XGBoost, and ensemble techniques. This approach enabled data-driven solutions for practical problems, emphasizing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

## Data Science: 
I designed and implemented predictive models, classification systems, and data analysis pipelines using Numpy, pandas and scikit-learn. By performing feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation, I delivered accurate, interpretable, and reliable solutions for real-world problems, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## AWS: 
Deployed AI solutions on AWS services such as SageMaker, Lambda, and EC2, creating scalable and production-ready applications. I focused on cloud infrastructure management, pipeline automation, and model deployment, ensuring systems are robust and efficient.
