## Projects
* **Top Deployed MicroServices**: Juggle Detection Counter Service, Face Matching Engine Service,
Voice Cloning Service

* Computer Vision:
  1. **Juggle Detection Counter Service (Deployed)**: Developed and deployed an asynchronous,
  multi-threaded juggle counting service on AWS that used Agentic AI for autonomous task orchestration, integrating
  YOLOv11 for detection, FastAPI for async APIs, and Docker for scalable deployment. Achieved 98% accuracy
  with sub-200 ms latency, supporting 100+ concurrent video streams via a fire-and-forget architecture.
  
  2. **Face Matching Engine Service (Deployed)**: Engineered and deployed an asynchronous face recognition
  service on AWS using Agentic AI to autonomously orchestrate detection, embedding generation, and matching,
  integrating YOLOv8, FaceInsight, and FastAPI with Cosine Similarity for sub-second, high-precision results.
  Utilized multi-threaded processing and Dockerized Farget deployment to handle 5K+ daily comparisons via a
  fire-and-forget architecture.

  3. **Custom Face Matching Model**: Built a Python-based face matching algorithm using OpenCV and
  NumPy, achieving high accuracy for pre-trained images through custom feature extraction, similarity metrics,
  and algorithm design, without relying on pre-built frameworks. Limitation: requires prior training images for
  accurate matching.

* Natural Language Processing (NLP):
  1. **Sms Spam Classifier**: Developed a sms spam email classifier in Python achieving 85% accuracy using
  scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Collected data from Kaggle, applied self and LLM-assisted data
  cleaning, and implemented preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation pipelines. Built a FastAPI
  interface for local inference; project was not deployed, demonstrating strong understanding of supervised learning
  workflows and end-to-end model development.

  2. **Movie Genre Multi-label Classification**: Built a Python-based model using pandas and scikit-learn to
  predict multiple genres per movie. Collected dataset from Kaggle, performed data cleaning and preprocessing, and
  trained a multi-label classification model for accurate genre prediction.

* Generative AI:
  1. **Chatbot**: Built an interactive chat application using Streamlit and the Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM, integrated via
  Google Generative AI API. Implemented a session-based conversation flow with start chat for context retention,
  enabling real-time user interaction and dynamic response generation through a simple web interface.

* Agentic AI:
  1. **Image2Insight**: Built a Python-based FastAPI service leveraging Agentic AI with Gemini LLM to
  autonomously process user-uploaded images—extracting text via OCR, translating it, and generating concise
  summaries in a single orchestrated flow, enabling fully automated, end-to-end image-to-summary processing.

  2. **Neural TTS & Voice Cloning Service (Deployed)**: Designed an asynchronous Python FastAPI
  microservice using ElevenLabs API for neural text-to-speech and voice replication, generating multiple outputs via
  API. Optimized with parallel request handling and multi-threaded preprocessing to achieve ¡1.5 s synthesis for 1,200+
  daily requests, and deployed on AWS with Docker and DynamoDB for scalable, low-latency storage and retrieval of
  cloned voice profiles.
