## Introduction:
FaceScan is a domain-specific Agentic AI service designed for face verification and identity metadata retrieval. Trained on curated image datasets, it can autonomously verify if an input image matches a known face and return structured metadata—including name, age, and other attributes—along with an identification confidence score. By combining AI-powered verification with database-driven metadata storage, FaceScan delivers a fast, reliable, and scalable solution for security, identity verification, and analytics applications.

## How FaceScan Works:
1. Model Training & Feature Encoding:
    * FaceScan is trained on a dataset of labeled images.
    * Each face is encoded into a feature representation used for verification.
2. Metadata Storage:
    * Associated identity information (name, age, etc.) is stored in MySQL.
    * Ensures efficient retrieval and structured outputs.
3. Face Verification:
    * A new image is submitted to the system.
    * The AI evaluates whether it matches a known face.
    * Returns a match score indicating identification confidence.
4. Structured Metadata Output:
    * If verified, the engine returns pre-stored metadata in JSON format.
    * Enables seamless integration into applications and analytics pipelines.

## Key Features:
* Accurate Verification: Confirms if a submitted image matches a trained identity.
* Identification Score: Provides a quantitative confidence measure for each verification.
* Rich Metadata Retrieval: Returns stored details such as name, age, and optional attributes.
* Database-Driven: Utilizes MySQL for secure, scalable, and structured data management.
* Scalable & Efficient: Optimized for high-throughput verification with fast response times.

## Why FaceScan Stands Out:
* Autonomous Operation: Acts like a domain-specific agent, verifying faces and returning metadata without manual intervention.
* Reliable & Fast: Delivers high-confidence results efficiently, suitable for real-world applications.
* Structured, Developer-Friendly Outputs: JSON format makes integration, filtering, and automation easy.
* Actionable Identity Insights: Goes beyond detection to provide meaningful identity data for analytics or access control.
